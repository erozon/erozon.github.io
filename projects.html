								<p>
                                In my master's, 
                                I am studying evolutionary discounting.
                                Briefly, human and non-human animals' observed
                                preferences for consumption across different time horizons seem irrational,
                                at least according to standard economic models of welfare optimization. However, there
                                is consistency in our irrationality, which suggests that perhaps there is a good reason for the behaviour 
                                we observe. In particular, I propose that observed discounting behaviour is consistent with optimizing
                                evolutionary fitness. In my thesis, I set out to address the question: 
                                <em>How does evolution mould our preferences for small, immediate rewards over larger, more
                                delayed rewards?</em>
                                </p>


                                <p>
                                At the end of my bachelor's degree, I spent a semester researching some algebra under 
                                <a href="https://mysite.science.uottawa.ca/mnevins/">Monica Nevins</a>. We generally think
                                of numbers as having a set size; 1 is less than 2, which is less than 3, and so forth. However, this is not
                                the only choice we could make. It turns out that there are only so many "reasonable" choices for the size
                                of a number, and that it is intimately related to prime numbers. Alternative orderings lead to different notions
                                of closeness, which in turn produce fascinating new systems, called the <em>p</em>-adic numbers. My thesis builds these
                                systems up from scratch to be accessible to those with a basic background in algebra and analysis, and 
                                applies the <em>p</em>-adic numbers to the study of quadratic forms.

                                <p>
                                I have completed several projects as a result of my studies and personal interests. I include here a sampling
                                of some completed projects. 
                                </p>

                                <ul>
                                    <li><b><a href="ot.pdf">Cournot-Nash Equilibria in Continuous Games:</a></b> From a course I took on optimal transport
                                        with applications in economics. I start with some classical game theory, which I then extend beyond discrete
                                        player games and analyse using some tools from the theory of optimal transport.
                                        </li>
                                        <li><b><a href="squirrellyBandits.pdf">Squirrelly Bandits:</a></b> From a course on evolutionary game theory. Reinfrocement learning algorithms
                                            tend to discount future rewards <em>exponentially</em>. I put forward a framework which can be analysed
                                            both as a reinforcement learning process and an evolutionary process. I find that in the proposed setup,
                                            the optimal evolutionary strategy can be recovered by appropriate choice of discounting parameter in the
                                            reinforcement learning setup. This project is tangentially related to the evolutionary discounting in my
                                            master's thesis.

                                        <li><b><a href="robustRegression.pdf">Robust Regression:</a></b> In 2016, I took a course on regression analysis (how to fit a line of
                                            best fit through data). Standard least squares
                                            regressions tend to assume large outliers are unlikely, to the extent that a single large outlier could
                                            destroy the statistical significance of a hypothesis. I worked in a team of two to analyse alternative,
                                            so-called "robust" regression methods.

                                        <li><b>Ontario High School Running:</b> In high school, my cross country/track coach at one point casually 
                                            remarked that after harder winters, you observe slower races in the spring. I set out to test his
                                            hypothesis. I collected both weather data and athletic performance data for different regions in Ontario
                                            and ran some simple regressions to conclude that colder winters are associated with worse athletic
                                            performance in longer events (1500 meters and up). 
                                            Unfortunately, the data for this project was lost in a computer upgrade I have yet to 
                                            replicate my findings.
