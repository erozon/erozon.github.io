											<h2>Who am I?</h2>
										</header>
										<p>I apply math to try and make sense of the world by striking a good balance between 
                                        concreteness and abstraction. My current academic interests include behavioural economics and
                                        <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_discounting">discounting</a>, game theory,
                                        <a href = "https://kantorovich.org">optimal transport</a> and its applications,
                                        and computers and modelling. 
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                        Having spent the past seven years dedicated to courses, research, and government work,
                                        I am now looking to apply my diverse set of skills and experiences 
                                        to help tackle problems outside of academia. My interests are varied, and I am not
                                        restricting my job search to any one field or industry. Most important to me is the
                                        opportunity to collaborate with others on challenging problems.

										<h3>Education</h3>
										<p>From St. Catharines to Ottawa to Vancouver, I have been in school for
                                        almost my entire life. I include a brief roadmap of where exactly I have been,
                                        what I have done there, and what I have learned.</p>

									</li>
									<li>
										<span class="icon solid major style3 fa-briefcase"></span>
										<h3>Professional Experiences</h3>
										<p>I have been careful to maintain touch with the professional world. While always
                                        devoted to my formal education, I have taken every opportunity to broaden my horizons and
                                        learn through practical experience.</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<span class="icon solid major style5 fa-running"></span>
										<h3>Personal Interests</h3>
										<p>My academic and professional resume paints an accurate but incomplete picture of myself.
                                        In the spirit of providing a wholistic sense of what makes me tick, 
                                        I here include some details about how I occupy my time when I'm not at work or school.

							<p>You should feel free to reach out to me for any reason. I am always eager to learn about
                            exciting projects in industry or academia. Furthermore, I recognize that any success I achieve
                            will be a direct result of others having generously helped me. As a result,
                            I am always happy to participate in outreach activities. </p>
