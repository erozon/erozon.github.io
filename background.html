                                <h2>Formal Education</h2>
								<p>
                                I am currently a second year master's student in mathematics at the University of British Columbia,
                                in Vancouver, Canada. Since September 2019, I have taken classes and researched evolutionary discounting 
                                schedules under the supervision of <a href="https://www.math.ubc.ca/~hauert">Christoph Hauert</a>.
                                My master's thesis, to do with evolutionary pressures to prefer small, more immediate rewards over
                                larger, more delayed rewards, is under construction. Though far from accessible, the adventurous reader
                                can find more on
                                <a href="https://github.com/erozon/SqurirelBanking/tree/master">Github</a>.
                                </p>
                                <p> 
                                Before coming to UBC, I studied economics and mathematics at the University of Ottawa. My studies
                                culminated in the writing 
                                of my <a href="https://mysite.science.uottawa.ca/mnevins/papers/EricRozonThesis.pdf">honour's project</a>,
                                which has even (to my pleasant surprise) been <a href="https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Quadratic-forms-over-the-p-adic-fields%3A-a-problem-Nevins-Rozon/0f613624b46b0f9dc17feba8f68641b39cb346fd">cited</a> 
                                a handful of times! Between my bachelor's and master's degrees, I have taken courses covering:
                                </p>

                                <ul>

                                        Groups, rings, fields, and Galois theory. 
                                        Measure theory, integration, and functional analysis. Probability and stochastic processes. 
                                        </li>
                                        <li><b>Applied math and economics:</b> Micro and macroeconomic theory. Monetary theory and policy.

                                </ul>

                                <h2>Work Experience</h2>
                                <p>
                                Through university positions, co-op programs, and interships I have worked steadily since 2014.
                                By making a positive contribution to the teams I have worked on, each experience has in turn
                                rewarded me with skills and knowledge which continue to serve me to the present.
                                Though in some ways very different, my work experiences are unified by the theme of communication.
                                Whereas school has taught me rigorous thinking and analysis, working with others has reinforced the
                                important point that information not effectively communicated may as well not exist. 
                                </p>

                                <ul>
                                    <li><b>Teaching assistant (UBC):</b> Functioned as a point of contact between students, university
                                        administration, and professors. Graded assignments, midterms, and final exams. Provided individual
                                        tutoring and facilitated group problem sessions and specialized course help sessions. 
                                        </li>
                                        <li><b>Government of Canada:</b> Worked in multiple federal departments such as Indigenous
                                            and Northern Affairs Canada. Drafted reports, performed research, and communicated findings
                                            in both oral and written formats for subject matter experts. Produced research tools in
                                            excel, Python, and SageMath. 
                                        </li>

                                            Worked as a research assistant to academics in London, Ottawa, and Rio de Janeiro. Accessed 
                                            Brazilian labour data, generated summary statistics, and performed regression analyses in

                                        </li>

                                            political staff to ensure the routine proceedings of Parliament. Responsibilities included
                                            memorizing the names, faces, and party affiliations of all 308 members, as well as the 
                                            collection and dissemination of confidential and sensitive documents in a non-partisan,
                                            bilingual fashion.

                                I have always been interested in learning languages. Throughout my time in Ottawa, I took advantae of
                                the opportunities afforded by the university's <a href="https://www.uottawa.ca/francophonie-bilingualism/">
                                    bilingualism</a>, taking about a third of my courses in French.
