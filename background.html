								<p>
                                I am currently employed as a Cyber Technologist (technical sales and client management) at Darktrace, helping clients to evaluate and leverage Darktrace's AI platform to prevent, detect, respond to and recover from cyber disruption. Prior to beginning this role in January 2022, 
                                I was a  master's student in mathematics at the University of British Columbia,
                                in Vancouver, Canada. My research focused on
                                <a href="https://erozon.github.io/projects.html">evolutionary discounting</a>
                                under the supervision of <a href="https://www.math.ubc.ca/~hauert">Christoph Hauert</a>.
                                Before UBC, I studied economics and mathematics at the University of Ottawa. The following list outlines
                                my major courses and areas of study.

                                <h2>Work Experience</h2>

                                <p>
                                I am currently a Graduate Teaching and Research Assistant at UBC. Previously, I have worked
                                in data visualization, applied mathematical/economic research, telemarketing, and the Canadian parliament.
                                My diverse work experiences are unified by the theme of communication. Independent of my role, 
                                the primary determinant of success has been clear and concise communication. I include a brief description
                                of some work experiences. 
                                </p>

                                            in both oral and written formats to subject matter experts. Produced research tools in

								<h2>Personal Interests</h2>
								<p>
                                Outside of work and school, I am most likely to be seen on a run. Some favourite locations include Pacific Spirit
                                Park in Vancouver, Gatineau Park outside of Ottawa, and along the shores of Lake Ontario in St. Catharines, Ontario.
                                I also enjoy swimming, freediving, tennis, table tennis, and chess. 
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                I have also always been interested in languages and travel. Throughout my time in Ottawa, I took advantage of
                                the opportunities afforded by the university's <a href="https://www.uottawa.ca/francophonie-bilingualism/">
                                    bilingualism</a>, taking about a third of my courses in French. In addition, I have been studying Spanish
                                since 2012. I participated in an exchange to Spain during high school, and have subsequently returned twice. Finally,
                                my work term in Brazil granted me the chance to learn some Portuguese. 
                                </p>
